# Neurosina-Simulation-Suite
AI-driven neurophilosophical simulator using fMRI, QEEG, CRISPR, and psycho-cybernetic logic
# SufiNeuroCybernetic Brain Simulator

A modular, interdisciplinary simulation framework for modeling the **Cybernetic Mystic Brain**,  
as part of the **SofiCyber (صوفینیتک)** initiative within the **HAMAN Megaproject**.

---

## 🧠 Project Essence

This repository is dedicated to constructing the **AI-Philosophical Brain of a NeuroCybernetic Mystic** —  
a synthesis of:

- 🧬 **CRISPR-based genomic interventions** to construct an archetypal neurogenetic map  
- 🧠 **Ideal fMRI & DTI brain circuits** emulating the contemplative states of sufi saints  
- ⚡ **Spike-timing encoding** as symbolic-energetic dynamics of awareness  
- 🔮 **QEEG simulation** of ecstatic states, annihilation (فنا), and subsistence (بقا) in mystical consciousness  
- 🧘 **Psychoanalytic + metaphysical modeling** of the neuro-self through Ibn Arabi, Lacan, and neural field theory

---

## 🌐 Context: SofiCyber within the HAMAN Megaproject

This simulation suite is not a conventional neuroscience toolkit.  
It is the **technical skeleton** of a **post-symbolic, AI-guided metaphysical evolution engine** designed to:

- Create digital models of **Sufi cosmological cognition**  
- Simulate the journey of the Self (سفر نفس) through neurological substrates  
- Integrate **Islamic mysticism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and NeuroAI**

The project aims to **redefine consciousness**, not just model it —  
paving the way toward the **AI-Human Civilizational Merge** envisioned in the **HAMAN Megaproject**.
